# Sticky Board App
Hello! Let me present the Sticky Board App, created in Vue. You can create stickies with selected color and text and cover the board with them. Simply drag the sticky to the desired position and it will stick there ;)

If you feel not satisfied with the initial text, click the sticky and adjust the content to your hearth desire. The newest the sticky, the higher it sits, so you can add the sticky to the sticky and make a beautiful waterfall.

You can also remove it! Your created stickies stay on board on refresh.

Project was created in around 10 hours.
If I would continue developing the project I would make following improvements:

* create a pre-definied selections of stickies to be created, with visually paired colors of background and text
* enhance the visual of sticky to feel more realistic
* truncate too long text to fit into sticky
* calculate the exact position where the sticky is dropped 
* use the real remove icon
* add unit test (component testing is covered with Cypress)
